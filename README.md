# Professional README.md Generator

## Description:
Creating an open source project on GitHub is important, so it is even more important to have a professional README.md file as it will ensure; clients, colleagues and employers understand the fundamental use and purpose of your application. The sole purpose of my project was to offer the GitHub community a solid application that would create ease by quickly generating a README.md file when using the command-line. Thus, allowing users among the GitHub community to save valuable time among their projects. Thereby, allowing them to optimize focus and efficency onto other priorities in order to achieve their goals.

# Overview
## The Challenge:
Create an effective command-line runned application that in-takes a users input inorder to dynamically generate a professional README.md file that will have a clean, minimal and visually appealing format.

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the cloned repository in a source code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code.
2. Open integrated terminal on index.js
3. Enter “node index.js” in the command line
4. Presented with npm inquirer questions through sequential order within the directory -  the user must provide essential README information in order to proceed to the next question in sequence.
5. Once completed a file named (Generated)README.md will be made.
6. At your discretion, you may rename the (Generated)README.md file to the file name of your choice.
7. (Optional) Regarding future use, you may alter the prompted questions within the index.js and generatedMarkdown.js to suit your needs.
